# Max Hamburgare
This is a project made by 4 students for a course in human-computer interaction. The app is split in 2: One view for ordering and one view for the staff in the kitchen. The goal was to make a user friendly burger ordering app, as well as being a tool for order-slip-management in the kitchen.

My main responsibilities have mainly been responsiveness (CSS Grid/Flexbox layouts, breakpoints etc), popups, data handling both inside and between the different views, handling the different presentations of orders in the kitchen view as well as having an overall responsibility of keeping the different components of the app modular.
